    "# Choreography Pattern — Notes and Runbook\n",
    "\n",
    "This file collects the relevant notes, run commands, and quick tests for the Choreography deployment in this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "- Choreography pattern uses Redis Pub/Sub and services that react to events.\n",
    "- Services: `order-service`, `inventory-service`, `payment-service`, `shipping-service`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compose / Ports\n",
    "From `saga_pattern/choreography_pattern/compose.yaml`:\n",
    "- MySQL: 3306\n",
    "- Redis: 6379\n",
    "- order-service: host port `8001` -> container `8001`\n",
    "- inventory-service: host port `8002` -> container `8002`\n",
    "- payment-service: host port `8003` -> container `8003`\n",
    "- shipping-service: host port `8004` -> container `8004`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start / Stop\n",
    "Start the choreography stack (build and detach):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd saga_pattern/choreography_pattern\n",
    "docker-compose up -d --build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop and remove containers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose down\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick smoke tests (host machine)\n",
    "- Health check (order service):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -v http://localhost:8001/health || curl -v http://localhost:8001/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create order (example):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/orders \\\n",
    "  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n",
    "  -d '{\"customerId\":\"customer-001\",\"bookId\":\"book-123\",\"quantity\":1}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you get `500` responses, collect logs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose logs --tail=200 --follow\n",
    "# or per service\n",
    "docker-compose logs order-service --tail=200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes / Troubleshooting Checklist\n",
    "- Ensure MySQL & Redis containers are healthy (check `docker-compose ps` and healthchecks).\n",
    "- Ensure DB initialization SQL (`dbconf/init_scripts/init.sql`) ran successfully; check MySQL logs for errors.\n",
    "- Verify environment variables for DB connection in services (e.g., `MYSQL_HOST`, `MYSQL_USER`).\n",
    "- If `500` errors persist, run the container interactively and test inside:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose exec order-service /bin/sh\n",
    "# then inside, try: curl http://inventory-service:8002/health\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful commands\n",
    "- Build only:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose build --no-cache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- View service logs across stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose logs --tail=200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run db scripts manually (example):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker-compose exec mysql mysql -ucloudmart_user -pcloudmart_pass cloudmart_saga < /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql\n",
    "```\n"
